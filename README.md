Different codes are available in the main branch :
- Inputs_changes.ipynb : it calculates the total solar irradiance and then the solar radiation absorbed by the wall and the glass during a week in february and in august. It uses the weather data of a specific place (in a .epw file). The files input_data_set_february.csv and input_data_set_august.csv are then completed by the code.
- Input_data_set_august.csv : file completed by Inputs_changes.ipynb
- Input_data_set_february.csv : file completed by Inputs_changes.ipynb
- simulation_controlleur:
- simulation_gain:
- walls_out:

For these codes, it is required that the file dm4bem.py is in the same folder as those ones in order for them to compile without errors.
